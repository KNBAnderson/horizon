## Description

_The objective of this project is to create a web application that can answer the following questions:_

1. What is the total length of the string that is created when all the integers between 1 and 123 are spelled out in English with no spaces or conjunctions?

- A section answering the first question
- UI set up similar to Horizon Investments website
